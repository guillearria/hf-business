# Hugging Face for Business

## Overview
This project is a machine learning platform designed to provide a business-friendly interface for interacting with machine learning models, repositories, and workflows. The platform leverages **SvelteKit** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, **MongoDB** for data storage, and **Hugging Face** for machine learning integration. The infrastructure is hosted on **AWS**, ensuring scalability, security, and reliability.

## MVP Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
- **Sign-up, Login, and Profile Management:** Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Authentication:** Implemented using JWT or OAuth for secure access.

### 2. **Model Browsing and Search**
- **Model Repository:** Users can browse and search machine learning models from Hugging Face's ML Hub.
- **Search Functionality:** Implemented in the frontend with integration to Hugging Face's API.

### 3. **Model Deployment and Inference**
- **Model Deployment:** Users can deploy models to scalable infrastructure (e.g., AWS Lambda, Hugging Face Spaces).
- **Inference API:** Users can run inference on deployed models via REST APIs.

### 4. **Monitoring and Analytics**
- **Basic Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of model performance (e.g., latency, accuracy).
- **Usage Analytics:** Display metrics and logs for deployed models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (or Amazon DocumentDB)
- AWS Account (for hosting and services)
- Hugging Face API Key

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guillearria/huggingface-for-business.git
   cd machine-learning-platform
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://your-mongo-uri
   HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=your-hugging-face-api-key
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Developments

### 1. **Collaboration Tools**
- **Forking and Pull Requests:** Allow users to fork models and submit pull requests for collaboration.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement role-based access control for teams and organizations.

### 2. **Advanced Model Management**
- **Model Training:** Integrate with AWS SageMaker for advanced model training.
- **Version Control:** Implement version control for models to track changes and updates.

### 3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Analytics**
- **Advanced Metrics:** Provide more detailed metrics and analytics for model performance.
- **Alerting System:** Implement an alerting system for model performance issues.

### 4. **User Interface Improvements**
- **Dashboard:** Create a comprehensive dashboard for users to manage models, deployments, and analytics.
- **Customizable Views:** Allow users to customize their views and preferences.

### 5. **Integration with Additional Services**
- **Other ML Hubs:** Integrate with other machine learning hubs and services.
- **Third-Party APIs:** Add support for third-party APIs and services.

### 6. **Scalability and Performance Enhancements**
- **Serverless Architecture:** Further leverage AWS Lambda for serverless functions.
- **Global CDN:** Enhance global content delivery using AWS CloudFront.
