# Hugging Face for Business

Welcome! This platform aims to make machine learning accessible to businesses by providing essential tooling to interact with **Hugging Face's ML Hub**. The platform empowers companies and individuals to host, run, and collaborate on machine learning models at scale.

This README provides an overview of the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** and outlines future developments for the platform.

## MVP Features

The MVP focuses on delivering the core functionality required to make the platform usable and valuable to early adopters. The following features are included:

### 1. User Authentication
   - Sign up, log in, and manage user profiles.
   - Secure authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.

### 2. Model Browsing and Search
   - Browse and search machine learning models from **Hugging Face's ML Hub**.
   - View model details (e.g., name, description, tags).

### 3. Model Deployment and Inference
   - Deploy models to scalable infrastructure (e.g., AWS Lambda, Hugging Face Spaces).
   - Run inference on deployed models via a simple API.

### 4. Basic Monitoring
   - View basic metrics for deployed models (e.g., latency, usage).



## Technology Stack

The platform is built using modern technologies to ensure scalability, performance, and developer productivity:

### Frontend
- **Svelte**: A modern frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety and improves developer experience.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and maintainability.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for building RESTful APIs.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user data, model metadata, and deployment logs.

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **AWS**:
  - **S3 + CloudFront**: Hosting and serving the frontend.
  - **Elastic Beanstalk/EC2**: Hosting the backend.
  - **DocumentDB**: Hosting MongoDB.
  - **Lambda**: Serverless functions for model inference.
  - **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging.

### Machine Learning Integration
- **Hugging Face's ML Hub**: Fetch models, run inference, and manage deployments.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud-hosted)
- **AWS Account** (for deployment)
- **Hugging Face API Token** (for model integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guillearria/huggingface-for-business.git
   cd huggingface-for-business
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:
     ```
     MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
     HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN=<your-hugging-face-token>
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-aws-access-key>
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-aws-secret-key>
     ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.



## Future Developments

The following features are planned for future iterations to enhance the platform:

### 1. Collaboration Tools
   - Forking and pull requests for models.
   - Role-based access control for teams and organizations.

### 2. Advanced Monitoring and Analytics
   - Real-time performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, latency).
   - Usage analytics for models and deployments.

### 3. Model Training
   - Integrate with **AWS SageMaker** or Hugging Face for model training.
   - Provide training pipelines and workflows.

### 4. Version Control
   - Track versions of models and datasets.
   - Enable rollback to previous versions.

### 5. Advanced Deployment Options
   - Support for custom deployment configurations (e.g., GPU instances).
   - Integration with Kubernetes for scalable deployments.

### 6. Community Features
   - User profiles with activity feeds.
   - Model reviews and ratings.

### 7. Marketplace
   - Allow users to publish and monetize models.
   - Provide a marketplace for datasets and pre-trained models.
