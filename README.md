# Hugging Face for Business

## Overview
This project is a machine learning platform designed to provide a business-friendly interface for interacting with machine learning models, repositories, and workflows. The platform leverages **SvelteKit** for both frontend and backend (server-side), **MongoDB** for data storage, and **Hugging Face** for machine learning integration. The infrastructure is hosted on **AWS**, ensuring scalability, security, and reliability.

## Architecture

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend & Backend:** SvelteKit (full-stack framework)
  - Server-side API routes for backend functionality
  - Server-side rendering (SSR) for improved SEO and performance
  - WebSocket integration for real-time monitoring
- **Database:** MongoDB
  - Document store for flexible model metadata
  - Time-series collections for metrics storage
  - Redis caching layer for performance optimization
- **Infrastructure:** AWS
  - ECS with Fargate for containerized deployment
  - S3 for model artifact storage
  - CloudFront CDN for global content delivery
  - CloudWatch for logging and monitoring
- **ML Integration:** Hugging Face
  - Inference API for model predictions
  - Model Hub API for repository browsing
  - Spaces API for deployment options

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (v6.0 or higher)
- Redis (v7.0 or higher)
- AWS Account with appropriate IAM permissions
- Hugging Face API Key

### Development Environment Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guillearria/huggingface-for-business.git
   cd huggingface-for-business
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Local Services:**
   ```bash
   # Start MongoDB and Redis using Docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # App
   PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NODE_ENV=development

   # Database
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/hf-business
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

   # Authentication
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-secret
   
   # External Services
   HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=your-hugging-face-api-key
   
   # AWS (for production)
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key
   ```

5. **Run Development Server:**
   ```bash
   # Start development server with hot reload
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the Application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Deployment
1. **Build the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to AWS:**
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CDK or similar IaC tool
   npm run deploy
   ```
